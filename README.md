# realtimebustracker

Description: 

This is an animation that utilizes MBTA bus data to display city bus stop locations using an animated marker at different times during its route from MIT to Harvard. Improvements made include cleaner button styling that has pressed effect as well as a back button that refreshes the page and allows the user to restart the route when the main button is clicked.

How to Run: 

    - go to https://github.com/rithvik1139/realtimebustracker
    - copy git repository
    - open index.html file in web browser

Future Improvements: 

The next step in this repository include adding a pause button to the interface. This in conjunction with creating a reversed path movement animation will make this project more versatile and complete.
